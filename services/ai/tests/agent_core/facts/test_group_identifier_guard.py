"""A prerequisite GROUP label must never be shown as if it were a course.

Groups are labelled `<course>.<n>` -- `00970800.0`, `00970800.1` -- which is
bookkeeping. A live answer read "the alternatives I derived are 00970800.0,
00970800.1", naming two things a student cannot register for instead of the four
course codes behind them.

Nothing else catches it. The tokens are slotted from a real fact, so the
grounding invariant passes them, and they LOOK like course codes to a reader --
which is what makes them worse than a visible error. So it is a post-condition:
the answer is refused and the reason handed back, the same way an impossible
grade is.
