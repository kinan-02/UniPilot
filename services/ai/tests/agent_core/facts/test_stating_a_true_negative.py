"""A true negative about a thing that does not exist could not be said.

The system prompt orders it explicitly:

    ASKED ABOUT A NAMED COURSE, CONFIRM IT EXISTS FIRST ... Nothing back means
    the code is not in the catalog, and NO conclusion about it is available --
    say that.

And `resolve_answer` refused every phrasing. Live, asked "Am I eligible for
course 00999999?", the agent searched the catalog twice, wrote three correct
answers, had all three rejected as "every fact the answer cites is empty", and
returned the give-up sentence to the student.

The rule itself is right and stays: "I can't determine: (none), (none)" is a
non-answer wearing the shape of a verified one, and it shipped once. What
separates that from a real negative is not completeness -- the comment in
`answer.py` says so, correctly -- it is HOW the fact is cited. `{name}` over an
empty collection renders "(none)" and asserts nothing. `{name:count}` renders
"0": a real derived number, about a real query, and the only way to state that
a thing was looked for and not found.
