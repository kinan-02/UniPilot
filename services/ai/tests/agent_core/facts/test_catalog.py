"""The tool catalog -- phase 9b of docs/agent/tools_implementation_plan.md.

Two failure modes worth testing, both observed in the system this replaces:

**Drift.** The old prompt kept tool names in hand-maintained prose, including
cross-references inside OTHER tools' notes. A tool removed from the registry
went on being described -- which silently corrupted an ablation experiment,
because the model was still being told about a tool that was not there.

**Examples that do not run.** A prompt teaching malformed JSON is worse than one
that says nothing, since the model has no reason to doubt it. Every example here
is parsed by the real codec.
