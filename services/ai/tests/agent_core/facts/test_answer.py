"""The answer boundary -- phase 9d of docs/agent/tools_implementation_plan.md.

The invariant in one line: no number reaches a reader unless a fact produced it.

The most important test here is the LAST one. The boundary this replaces had a
structural gap -- interpreted prose fitted neither of its two categories, so
some answers had no legal form and the loop exhausted itself discovering that.
Typed facts remove the category rather than widening it, and that test is what
proves it.
