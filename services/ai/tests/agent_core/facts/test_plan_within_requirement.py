"""The plan was never checked against what the degree still needs.

Every other post-condition is PER TERM. On 2026-08-20 two live runs of "how many
semesters will it take me to graduate", minutes apart on identical data, scored
`correct` and answered **2** and **4**:

    run 0   10 courses   28.0 credits   ->  2 semesters
    run 1   13 courses   38.5 credits   ->  4 semesters

Every term inside run 1 was legal -- 16, 12, 7, 3.5 against an 18 cap -- so
`check_term_load` and `check_term_within_cap` both passed it, and nothing else
looked at the plan whole.

The data, checked by SQL rather than against the agent:

    completed (creditsCounted, passed)   129.5
    degree requires                      155.0
    remaining REQUIREMENT                 25.5
    remaining track courses    21 courses  50.0   (17.5 mandatory + 32.5 elective)

The student must take the 6 mandatory courses and then ANY 8 credits of the
32.5 on offer. Run 1 scheduled all 21, which is the "remaining means two
different things" defect one layer further in than where it was last fixed: not
in what the answer REPORTS, but in what the planner is FED.

The threshold is deliberately loose. Overshoot alone is normal -- courses are
indivisible, so 28 credits against a 25.5 requirement is simply the cost of
finishing, and run 0 is a correct answer. Only an overshoot that changes the
term count is a violation, because that is the one that reaches the student as a
wrong number.
