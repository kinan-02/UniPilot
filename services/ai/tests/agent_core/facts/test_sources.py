"""The source registry -- phase 11 of docs/agent/tools_implementation_plan.md.

These schemas are a CLAIM about real collections, so the tests check the claim
against the real documents rather than against the schema file. A registry that
only agrees with itself is a way of being confidently wrong.

Skips loudly without Mongo, and skips per-collection when a collection is empty:
an empty collection cannot contradict a schema, and pretending otherwise would

copy -- auditing the wrong database returned a number that looked like an answer. Both were minted in the same window as the catalog seed (2026-06-23/26)
and the records carry NO metadata -- no course number, title, or offering id --
so which course they represent is unrecoverable from the data.

Neither known write path produced them: the completed-course route has validated
`courseId` against the catalog since 2026-06-20, and transcript import both
validates and stamps `metadata.importSource`, which these lack. The writer is
unidentified.

The number is pinned rather than tolerated. Growth means the unknown writer ran
again, which is the only thing anyone can act on without knowing what those two
courses were.

image ships no tests, so this case skips on every machine -- and a check that
always skips is a green tick meaning nothing. The real guard is
`scripts/audit_orphaned_course_references.py`, which reaches the database through
