"""The turn loop -- phase 10 of docs/agent/tools_implementation_plan.md.

The model is scripted, so what is under test is the LOOP: whether it terminates,
whether it feeds failures back usefully, and whether the governors fire on the
behaviours that motivated this whole redesign.

Two of those behaviours are named directly in the tests below, because they are
the ones that were observed live and started the work:

  - finding the answer and then wandering into empty turns
  - being rejected with no legal move and burning the budget rediscovering it
