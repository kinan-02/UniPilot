"""Tests for the course code -> display-name lookup used at the answer boundary.

The live evals shipped answers like "The courses on your record with a final
grade above 90 are: 00940704, 00940219, 03240033." -- correct, grounded, and
close to unreadable. 7 of 10 answers in the 2026-07-18 run carried bare codes.

The name CANNOT come from the model: the grounding backstop only checks numerals
(`_NUM.findall`), so a typed course name is never validated, and a plausible
fabricated name welded to a real code is worse than no name at all -- the user
has no reason to doubt it. So the name is looked up in code and rendered, never
composed.
