"""The fact type system -- phase 1 of docs/agent/tools_implementation_plan.md.

Everything the algebra asserts against lives here. Three ideas carry their
weight:

`Quantity` vs `Identifier` is a TYPE, not a string shape. A course code is an
identifier that happens to be digits; typing it is what makes summing course
codes a type error instead of something a leading-zero heuristic has to guess at.

Certainty travels with the RECORD's origin, not with a field-name map, because a
`union` of two collections can carry the same field name with different
provenance on each side -- unrepresentable in a map keyed by field name.

Completeness is a property of a COLLECTION, distinct from the certainty of the
facts inside it. Every record on a truncated page can be individually perfect
while a `count` over that page is confidently wrong. Per-fact certainty cannot
express that, which is why `complete`/`total` ride on the collection itself.
