"""The answer boundary -- phase 9d of docs/agent/tools_implementation_plan.md.

The last check before a person reads anything: every number in the answer must
come from a fact, and the answer's confidence must be the weakest thing it
stands on.

**Why this is simpler than the version it replaces.** The old boundary sorted
answer content into "slot-filled token" or "free prose", and interpretation --
a cited paragraph -- was neither. It was a value the model had to state
verbatim, so it could not be a slot, and it carried a claim, so it could not be
free prose. That gap produced a rejection with no legal move, and the loop
burned its remaining turns discovering there wasn't one.

Typed facts remove the third category rather than accommodating it. `interpret`
returns a typed SCALAR plus a separate CITATION, so the value is slottable like
any other and the prose it came from travels alongside the answer instead of
inside it.

inside Hebrew prose. `check_prerequisites` is worse than untranslated: it is an
instruction to the system, and a student reading it has been handed a variable
name.

This is a presentation decision in code, which `_render_scalar` already makes:
a bool has been printed as "yes"/"no" since the beginning, for exactly this
reason. So the boundary is not new here, only wider. It stays narrow in the
ways that matter -- an explicit table, a closed vocabulary read off the two
modules that emit it (`planning/term_plan.py`, the track catalog), and ANY
value not listed passes through untouched, so an enum nobody anticipated is
rendered as-is rather than mangled.

Kept SHORT on purpose. The label beside them is the model's to name, so the
value has to compose with whatever it picks: "prerequisites met" reads well
until the label is already `prerequisites`, and then the row says "prerequisites
meets-the-prerequisites". A short value degrades gracefully in both directions.
