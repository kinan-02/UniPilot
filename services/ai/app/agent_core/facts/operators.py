"""The operator basis and its type checker -- phase 3 of
docs/agent/tools_implementation_plan.md.

The basis is relationally complete plus aggregation and ordering. That is a
narrower claim than "can express anything" and the difference matters: it
provably cannot express transitive closure, which is why `traverse` is a
separate primitive rather than an operator here.

Checking is TABLE-DRIVEN. Each operator declares its operand types, their
grounding position, and how each collection input reacts to incompleteness --
and one generic checker reads that table. The alternative, a hand-written
validation branch per operator, is what keeps a basis small: the cost of adding
an operator becomes O(error modes) by hand, so nobody adds one, so capability
arrives instead as pre-solved shortcuts. A table row is cheap enough that the
basis can be complete.
