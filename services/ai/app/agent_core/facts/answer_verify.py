"""The independent verify step: replay a plan answer's own numbers against the
post-conditions before it ships.

`resolve_answer` proves provenance -- every number came from a fact. This proves
SENSE: no impossible grade, no GPA out of range, and the plan's minimums hold the
floor when the courses are taken together, not just one at a time. It is the
check the grounding invariant structurally cannot be: a genuine, correctly-sourced
fact can still be an impossible grade or answer a subtly different question, and a
live winter run shipped exactly that -- six per-course minimums, two negative,
that jointly drop the GPA to 65 against an 80 floor.

Unlike the eval scorer (`tests/.../plan_eval_scoring.py`), which parses a saved
answer's prose because that is all it has, this reads the TYPED facts the answer
was built from: the plan comes from the Collection behind a `:detail` slot, whose
records carry `credits` and `min_grade` as real numbers, and the standing comes
from the scalar facts the min-grade formula itself consumes (`total_points`,
`total_credits`). Reading the facts, not the rendered text, keeps the check exact.

A verdict is a list of `Violation`s -- empty when the answer is sound, or when it
holds nothing these checks judge. It is NOT limited to min-grade plans: that was
the original scope and it left an ordinary term plan entirely unexamined, which
is how "Winter -- 23 credits" shipped against an 18-credit cap. Any answer
slotting a collection whose records carry `credits` is now load-checked, with
the grade checks skipping rows that claim no minimum.

A non-empty verdict is handed back to the loop as a loud, specific reason to try
again, in the same voice a rejected answer already is.
