    That matters more now the ceiling is 60s rather than the 300s this project
    believed it had, because the questions that exhaust it are the substantial
    ones -- and they are precisely the runs holding the most.

    names they were derived under. No model call: there is by definition no time
    left for one. Nothing is inferred or combined -- combining is the step that
    ran out of time, and guessing at it here would be inventing the answer the
    loop declined to give.
