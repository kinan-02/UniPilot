"""JSON to pipelines -- phase 9a of docs/agent/tools_implementation_plan.md.

The algebra is only worth having if a model can write it, so this is where the
design's constructibility claim gets tested by a parser rather than argued.

Every error here names both the mistake and the legal alternatives. That is not
politeness: a model handed "invalid pipeline" has nothing to act on and re-emits
the same thing, burning a turn per attempt. The old expression tree learned this
the hard way, and the lesson is cheaper to copy than to relearn.

    IS `{"value": 90}` -- that is the only way to write one, because a bare
    number there would be an ungrounded typed digit. In a predicate it was a
    bare `90`, and the wrapped form fell through to `_scalar`, which was handed
    a dict and could not type it.

    The error then made it unrecoverable. It said "give an explicit 'kind'", so
    the model wrote `{"kind": "quantity", "value": 90}` -- and `kind` is read
    from the PREDICATE level, not from inside the value, so the same message
    came back telling it to do what it had just done. Live, on "how many credits
    at each grade level", that cost six turns and the run returned nothing.

    Accepting the wrapped form makes one literal spelling work in both places,
