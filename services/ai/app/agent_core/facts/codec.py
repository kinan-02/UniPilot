"""JSON to pipelines -- phase 9a of docs/agent/tools_implementation_plan.md.

The algebra is only worth having if a model can write it, so this is where the
design's constructibility claim gets tested by a parser rather than argued.

Every error here names both the mistake and the legal alternatives. That is not
politeness: a model handed "invalid pipeline" has nothing to act on and re-emits
the same thing, burning a turn per attempt. The old expression tree learned this
the hard way, and the lesson is cheaper to copy than to relearn.
