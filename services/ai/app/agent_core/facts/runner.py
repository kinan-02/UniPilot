"""The pipeline runner -- phase 4 of docs/agent/tools_implementation_plan.md.

One call evaluates MANY named pipelines. That is the turn-cost fix: if a call
yields one fact, an N-step derivation costs N turns and each turn carries its
own rejection risk, which is the wandering this redesign exists to remove.

Two properties the runner owes its caller:

  - **order comes from the references**, not the caller's listing, so a model
    that declares pipelines backwards still succeeds
  - **failure is per pipeline**. Discarding four good results because a fifth
    failed forces a repair loop to redo work that was already correct, and a
    dependent of a failure is BLOCKED rather than failed -- a different repair.
