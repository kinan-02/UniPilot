Phase 11 built the primitives and the registry. This connects the ones whose
inputs live somewhere other than a Mongo collection, and it exists because of a
gap found by probing rather than by reading: the catalog advertised eight tools
and only three could actually be used. Two crashed on a `None` dependency, three
had no obtainable inputs, and nothing in the test suite noticed -- every one of
