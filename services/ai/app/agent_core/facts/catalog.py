"""The tool catalog -- phase 9b of docs/agent/tools_implementation_plan.md.

The other half of constructibility. The codec accepts good JSON; this is what
makes the model write good JSON in the first place.

**Generated, not hand-written.** The operator table and the sugar list are
rendered from `OPERATORS` and `SUGAR` at call time, so adding an operator
updates the prompt and cannot be forgotten. The previous system kept tool names
in hand-maintained prose -- including cross-references inside OTHER tools'
notes -- and they drifted: a tool deleted from the registry went on being
described, which corrupted an ablation experiment before anyone noticed the
prompt still mentioned it.

Every example here is executed by the test suite. A prompt that teaches the
model malformed JSON is worse than one that says nothing, because the model has
no reason to doubt it.
