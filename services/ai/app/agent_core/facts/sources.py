"""The source registry -- phase 11 of docs/agent/tools_implementation_plan.md.

`find` refuses to guess whether "3.5" is a quantity and "00940224" is an
identifier, so something has to declare it. This is that declaration.

**Derived from the stored documents, not from the API's input models.** The
first version of this file read `services/api/app/schemas/*.py` and was wrong in
four places, because an input model describes what an endpoint ACCEPTS, not what
Mongo holds. Checked against the live collections (2026-07-19):

  - `completed_courses.courseId` is an **ObjectId** referencing `courses._id`,
    not a course code. Declaring it a string made every transcript fetch fail at
    admission, since the key itself is one.
  - `completed_courses` carries **no `courseNumber` at all** (0 of 93). A course
    code is only reachable by joining to `courses` on that ObjectId -- which the
    old tool layer did in Python, and which is now an ordinary `join`.
  - `semester_plans` stores `semesters[]`, each with its own
    `plannedCourses[]`. There is no top-level `semesterCode` (0 of 247).
  - Plans DENORMALISE `courseNumber` into `plannedCourses[]` while transcripts
    do not, so the two need different routes to the same fact.

Verify with `tests/agent_core/facts/test_sources.py`, which checks these claims
against real documents rather than against this file.
