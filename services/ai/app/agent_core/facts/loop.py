"""The turn loop -- phase 10 of docs/agent/tools_implementation_plan.md.

Everything below this is deterministic. This is the one place a model decides
anything, so it is also the only place the old failure modes can return, and the
governors here are aimed at those specifically:

**Wandering after the answer was found.** The old loop would reach a sufficient
fact set and then spend its remaining turns not knowing it was done. A turn that
produces no new fact and attempts no answer is not thinking -- it is stalling,
and `NO_PROGRESS_LIMIT` ends it rather than letting the wall clock do it.

**Rejection with no legal move.** The old answer boundary could reject every
formulation the model had, so it burned the budget rediscovering that. Rejections
are bounded here AND carry the reason back, so a retry differs from its
predecessor. If they run out, the loop stops and says why rather than shipping
something unverified.

    grounded flows through it, so it never carries a number or a course code.

    `history` is the PRIOR exchanges of a conversation, so a follow-up like
    "continue" resolves against what was already said. It is context, never
    fact: the model reads it to interpret the question but re-derives every value
    fresh, so a stale answer from a past turn cannot re-enter as a pseudo-fact.

    `time_budget_s` is a WALL-CLOCK bound on the whole request, checked between
    turns. It concludes the loop gracefully -- with the transcript it has, which
    an outer `wait_for` cancellation would throw away -- rather than capping the
