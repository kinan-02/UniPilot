"""The turn loop -- phase 10 of docs/agent/tools_implementation_plan.md.

Everything below this is deterministic. This is the one place a model decides
anything, so it is also the only place the old failure modes can return, and the
governors here are aimed at those specifically:

**Wandering after the answer was found.** The old loop would reach a sufficient
fact set and then spend its remaining turns not knowing it was done. A turn that
produces no new fact and attempts no answer is not thinking -- it is stalling,
and `NO_PROGRESS_LIMIT` ends it rather than letting the wall clock do it.

**Wandering that LOOKS productive.** The guard above asks whether a fact
arrived, and a re-derivation always produces one, so renaming the output made a
lap invisible to it: ten measured runs showed the same `search_corpus` query
issued sixteen times and the same pipeline recomputed five times, every lap
resetting the no-progress counter. Progress is therefore counted against
`_call_signatures` -- what a call DERIVES, with names stripped -- so a lap round
the same derivation is what it is: no progress, reported back to the model.

**Rejection with no legal move.** The old answer boundary could reject every
formulation the model had, so it burned the budget rediscovering that. Rejections
are bounded here AND carry the reason back, so a retry differs from its
predecessor. If they run out, the loop stops and says why rather than shipping
something unverified.

legitimately spends a turn producing the key and another using it, and a model

runs that were converging; the guard is against WANDERING, not against thinking.

Raised again from 3 when `_call_signatures` landed. That change made a repeated
derivation count as no progress -- correctly -- but it also made this number
mean something much stricter than it used to: before it, almost nothing reset
the counter's opposite, so three was nearly unreachable. Holding it at three
turned a run that would have thrashed and eventually converged into one that
stalled and returned nothing, which is the worse outcome of the two. Measured on

different derivation, so the repeat guard misses it too.

Measured: asked for a minimum attendance percentage, which the regulations do
not set, a run issued 17 searches across 39 turns and 216 seconds. A second,

    grounded flows through it, so it never carries a number or a course code.

    `history` is the PRIOR exchanges of a conversation, so a follow-up like
    "continue" resolves against what was already said. It is context, never

    an outer `wait_for` cancellation would throw away -- rather than capping the
