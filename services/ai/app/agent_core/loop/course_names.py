"""Course code -> human-readable name, for rendering answers a student can read.

The live evals shipped grounded, correct, near-unreadable answers: "The courses
on your record with a final grade above 90 are: 00940704, 00940219, 03240033."
Seven of ten answers in the 2026-07-18 run carried bare codes.

The name cannot come from the model. The grounding backstop checks NUMERALS
only (`answer_boundary._NUM`), so a course name typed into prose is never
validated -- and a plausible fabricated name attached to a real code is worse
than no name, because nothing about it invites doubt. So the name is read from
the catalog here, in code, and slotted at the answer boundary exactly as every
other grounded value is.

Source is the course wiki page's frontmatter title, which reads
`<code> — <English name> (<Hebrew name>)` and covers 2601 of 2611 course pages.
`engine.graph.nodes[code]["name"]` is NOT the source: it is Hebrew-only and
missing outright for some courses (00940704, 01040065 among them).
