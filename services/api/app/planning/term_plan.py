"""Pure term-plan orchestration -- the engine behind the agent's `plan_term` tool.

The agent supplies eligible CANDIDATE courses and one or more target terms; this
places them into a conflict-free weekly schedule, term by term, mirroring how a
student builds a plan by hand on the /plans page.

It REUSES the audited schedule/exam primitives (`pick_lessons_for_course`,
`slots_overlap`, `exams_from_offering`, `extract_lesson_options_from_offering`,
`build_weekly_schedule_payload`, `build_exam_summary`) but does NOT wrap
`select_conflict_aware_courses`, because that selector was proven (2026-07-21) to
seat a course even when its only lesson option hard-overlaps an occupied slot --
its "fewest overlaps" pick returns the least-bad combo, not a conflict-free one.
So the conflict-free guarantee is enforced HERE: a course whose chosen slots
overlap an already-placed course is DROPPED to `unscheduled`, never reserved.

Prerequisites and corequisites are FLAGGED, not hard-dropped (the app's
never-overclaim stance): a placed course carries `prereqStatus` / `coreqStatus`
so the caller can warn without the tool silently deciding eligibility. The one
hard exclusion is a no-additional-credit overlap with an already-credited course
(there is no benefit to taking it), which mirrors the planner's overlap rule.

Everything here is PURE -- catalog, offerings and completed courses are passed in
already loaded -- so it is unit-testable without Mongo. The DB wiring lives in the
service layer.
